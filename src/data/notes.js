          "A few months ago I had the privilege of being able to enter and see parts of western Syria. We went to see a few of the country’s major cities and ancient historical sights. Our trip was very emotionally challenging but also beautiful in many ways. Meeting Syrians, hearing their stories and capturing a small part of what the country looks like today was not a simple goal but one I hope you will enjoy joining me on. Sending lots of love to all of the Syrians of the world. Thank you for welcoming me and teaching me about your culture.",

It’s a story about Ammar’s dream to climb the Pyramid of Giza and where that actually led him to...a dream he never knew he had, deep in the jungles of Guatemala. Thank you for those of you who supported the paywall for the past month, you made this doc and future ones possible for us. Thank you to all of you for supporting our dreams. Hope you enjoy the film now here on YouTube!",

          "From living in a 100 sqft apartment to building multiple companies, how did Kunal Shah become Kunal Shah? Why does he do what he does? What is he truly chasing if he is not chasing money? I sit down with Kunal Shah to talk about things you perhaps would not have heard before; and am sure you would find the conversation as enriching as I did, while speaking to him.",
